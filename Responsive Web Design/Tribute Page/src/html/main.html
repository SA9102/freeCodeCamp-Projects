                <h2>Works and Achievements:</h2>
                    <p>As well as developing and popularising AC electricity, Tesla developed different sorts of electrical and mechanical devices, and experimented with existing ones. His works have pioneered different technologies, and have significantly shaped the world to what it is today. But even though Tesla came up with a lot of ideas and patents, many of them were not implemented, or did not appeal to others much. Nonetheless, he had a genius mind. Here are some of his known works:</p>
                    <ul id="achievements-info">
                        <li><div class="device">Tesla Coil</div> - Tesla was experimenting with ways to produce electricity. Eventually, he came up with the 'Tesla Coil', which was a transformer that could produce AC electricity, and later on he would use this device in some of his other experiments.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">Bladeless Turbine</div> - Telsa developed a bladeless turbine which operated on 150kW, though unfortunately it never became a practical device. However, it was used in speedometers of cars.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">Reciprocating Electricity Generator</div> - This device generated alternating current through the use of steam, and was simpler than a steam engine.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">Radio Remote Control</div> - Tesla developed a boat which he called 'teleautomaton'. This boat could be controlled through the use of radio signals, from a remote device. Tesla thought that they could be used as torpedoes for the military.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">X-Rays</div> - Experimented with x-rays, using a vacuum tube which he developed himself. He researched different ways to produce x-rays, and also realised that there were hazards when working with x-rays.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">Wireless Communication</div> - Tesla was interested in wireless communication, and developed a few experiments to try to wirelessly transmit radio signals. He came up with a wireless tuning patent.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="device">Wireless Lighting</div> - As well as wireless communication, Tesla was also keen on wireless lighting; he devised experiments to try and turn on lights using AC electricity that was produced with his Tesla coil. He developed a wireless lighting system which he demonstrated around Europe and America.

                <h2>Timeline of Nikola Tesla's Life:</h2>
                    <ul id="timeline-info">
                        <li><div class="year">1856</div> - Born in Smiljan in the Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1870 - 1873</div> - Attended the Higher Real Gymnasium school at Karlovac, and graduated. He was able to perform complex mathematical calculations in his head. Tesla thought of electricity as a "mysterious phenomena" and wanted to "know more of this wonderful force".</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1881</div> - Worked at a telephone exchange in Budapest, where he was assigned the role of being in charge of the electrical equipment.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1882</div> - Tesla got a job with the Continental Edison Company in Paris. At first he was installing incandescent lighting around the city, but he was then tasked with improving mechanical devices, after the management realised his talents in engineering and physics.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1884</div> - Tesla's manager, Charles Batchelor, saw his talents in Paris, and wanted him to work at Edision Machine Works in New York City, and Tesla agreed. Tesla met the company owner, Thomas Edison, a few times. Although Edison was initially impressed with Tesla's work, Tesla decided to leave the company after just six months of working there.</li><br>                        
                        <li><div class="year">1885 - 1886</div> - Telsa went on to set up his own company, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing. However, the investors abandoned the company as they were not very keen on his ideas. This left Tesla with no money, and had to resort to working at electrical repair shops, as well as digging ditches. "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery", Tesla quoted.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1888</div> - At the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, George Westinghouse, who was an entrepreneur and engineer, was informed of Tesla's AC motor, which Westinghouse needed for his system. Westinghouse hired Tesla as a consultant in his company, Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing, in Pittsburgh.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">Late 1880s</div> - The "war of the currents" began, between Edison Electric and Westinghouse Electric. Westinghouse and Tesla were promoting the AC system, while Edison was promoting the DC system, claiming that it was better.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1890 - 1891</div> - During the Baring crisis in 1890, Westinghouse Electric suddenly faced a cash shortage, despite winning the "war of the currents". When Westinghouse explained to Tesla the situation, Tesla agreed to take away his own royalties.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1893</div> - Westinghouse Electric lighted the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 with AC electricity, demonstrating to the public that AC was safe and efficient.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1893</div> - Westinghouse Electric was chosen to build a system that transmitted power which was generated at the Niagara Falls, thanks to Tesla's suggestions that a two-phased AC system would be best.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1895</div> - The Nikola Tesla Company was established, with the help of Edward Dean Adams. Tesla wanted the company to market some of his past and future patents and inventions. However, some his patents, including wireless lighting, did not get marketed due to financial difficulties.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1895</div> - Tesla's lab in New York caught fire, destroying some of his assets, which includes notes, models and research material. "I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?", he told The New York Times.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1899 - 1900</div> - Tesla set up a laboratory in Colorado Springs, planning to conduct experiments which included producing electricity, as well as transmitting telegraph signals. He wanted to provide electricity free of charge.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1901 - 1917</div> - Tesla wanted to build a tower that was capable of wirelessly transmitting electrical energy across the Atlantic. This tower was constructed, and was named "Wardenclyffe Tower". However, it did not receive the popularity that Tesla hoped it would, as investors opted to put their money into Marconi's radio, instead of Tesla's tower. Due to financial difficulties, the project was stopped in 1905. Years later, Tesla lost the property due to foreclosure, and was eventually destroyed.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1900</div> - Tesla continually moved from one hotel to another, living in each hotel for a number of years until the bills were very high. Meanwhile, Tesla would feed and care for pigeons daily, and would also continue to work on some inventions, including a 'death ray'.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1934</div> - Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker. This time, he was able to stay there permanently, as Westinghouse provided the money for his rent.</li><br>
                        <li><div class="year">1943</div> - He died in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker, at the age of 86.</li>
